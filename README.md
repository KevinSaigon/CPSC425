# CPSC425 (2023W1)

As a friend once told me "you can either pay me in cash, or in kind". But I'm not interested in money - I'm interested in Stars, baby! 

Please leave a star on the repo if you found this useful ðŸ˜„

How to view: You could pull the repo and use your preferred markdown editor/viewer (I use Typora, and I hear VSCode is pretty good too) - this would yield the best viewing experience. If not, you could also just download the associated PDF, this was exported from the Markdown so I can't guarantee the quality.

## Course Review

### Term: 2023W1

The course covers pretty interesting topics that touch on a lot of different areas of Computer Vision. They span from very basic things like Gaussian Pyramids, template matching using convolutions, all the way to more complex topics like SIFT and Neural Networks. The material itself is quite interesting and I do find myself recalling back to them in my day-to-day life at times (I recently had a 10 minute conversation with my optometrist about how humans perceive colours - it's the last chapter of this course if you're interested)

However, I was not particularly a fan of how the course was structured or taught. The slides are recycled from the course back in 2007 - and they are not even good. They lack any real content or cues as to what the material is - countless time I've read a slide and just asked myself "what is this even referring to". Needlessly to say, attendance is a must, however, even with attendance, the class covers so much material that if you miss something, it's likely gone forever. I also don't believe that the slides present the material very well, simple things are made to be convoluted and complex things are dumbed down to the point where they're unrecognizable. 

The assignments were actually quite useful, they help reinforce the ideas we've learned in class (if you understood them at all, that is) and give you a sense of how to apply these theory and algorithms to real life scenarios. The exams, however, was a different beast. The lack of practice material made it extremely difficult to prepare for the exam. You basically re-read the slides over and over hoping that you're able to apply them on the exam. Extremely stressful

### Closing thoughts

Perhaps due to my Stockholm syndrome, despite its flaws, I enjoyed the course material (I, however, did NOT enjoy studying for the course). If UBC credits is no issue, there are better CV courses out there (see below). Assignments were enjoyable. Should 100% take CPSC 340 before taking this course (even though I'd say this course was easier than 425) - 340 go in-depth on a lot of topics that this course barely touch on (though, this did not stop them from testing it in depth, i.e we spent 5 minutes of a lecture on K-Means clustering, then a "perform a couple of iterations of K-means" question showed up on the final - literally just had to pull my 340 knowledge to do that question).
